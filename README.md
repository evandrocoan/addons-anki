>Explain grammar in the following Japanese sentence: {{{Sentence}}}

The result will be saved in a field of your choice, for example in the "Grammar Explanation" field.  

You can use multiple fields, too, for example: 

>Is the word {{{Word}}} used in a literate or figurative sence in the following sentence? {{{Sentence}}}
